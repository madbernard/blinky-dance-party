# blinky-dance-party

This is a project I worked on as a student at Hack Reactor, while pairing with with [@sgao103](https://github.com/sgao103).  The project focuses on subclassing Pseudoclassical constructor functions by making different "dancers" on a page, starting with a blinking dot that shows up in a random place.  Our "horndog" dancer that spirals in on a fellow dancer was a lot of fun.
